Short personal update on why I havenâ€™t been posting lately,

I had started out a few weeks ago with my TIL series, where I was attempting to learn one new thing a day related to programing/technology/something. For the last two or so weeks, I really havenâ€™t been spending much time on it as Iâ€™ve reached a hard point in my work-life balance. Iâ€™ve been spending so much time focused on work that Iâ€™ve been neglecting myself and what I need. Quite frankly Iâ€™m burnt out. Work isnâ€™t rewarding to me, and itâ€™s really hard to pull myself up and sink half of my free time every day into even more work.

Rather than focusing on things that I feel I need to do, Iâ€™m trying to actually focus on things that I do NEED to do. Like improving my personal outlook, remembering to eat meals, sleeping, doing things that give me some level of enjoyment. Trying to find what it means to be happy.

Starting this week Iâ€™m going to try to get back into the habit of working on TIL posts. One post a day of something I learned that day. Maybe itâ€™s technical, maybe itâ€™s a life lesson. I feel like the daily process of reflection helps things to stick better. In fact, a lot of today has already been spent reflecting on how effective training courses are for the way that I learn. That will probably be an upcoming entry.

Mini rant over. Letâ€™s all have a nice week.
