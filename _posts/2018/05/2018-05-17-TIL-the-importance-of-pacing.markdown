Warning: today's post is going to be a little bit different from what I usually post.

Today I learned (or confirmed) what I have been suspecting for a long time now:

I have a problem with work ethic.

And it's not the kind of problem that people usually think of when they talk about work ethic problem. I'm not lazy, I don't avoid getting my work done, or try my hardest to pass off my assignments to other members of my team so I can spend the afternoon chit-chatting.

Rather my problem is that I try to do too much.

And it's killing me.

This feeling consumed me towards the end of my last job, where no matter how much I worked on things, I was always behind. There was no catching up. There was no finish line, only a sprint that never seemed to end.

And now that same thing is happening to me again. And I've brought it on myself.

I don't seem to know how to say "no" in the work place. Oh, you need help with that? Sure, no problem. Need some help working through that problem? Be right over. We need some way of getting this special case working? Say no more.

I'm slowly working myself to death.

My brain never stops. I don't know what it means to have fun anymore. All I can ever think about is what projects need to be done, how am I going to get them done, and worrying about what will happen if they don't get done.

"All I know is how to work" is a phrase that's been haunting me for the last few years. On my way to moving up the ranks I've sacrificed my real life for my work. Nearly everything that once brought me happiness is no longer interesting. Because even when I'm "relaxing", my brain is still churning 100 miles a second.

The problem? I don't know what to do with this information. It's not like I can stop working, I have bills to pay. People to feed.

If there's anything to take away from this, it's learning to say "no" before it's too late. Once you've started down the path of "yes", your burnout is imminent.

People often ask me why I seem so stressed all of the time. This post would be my answer to that question.
