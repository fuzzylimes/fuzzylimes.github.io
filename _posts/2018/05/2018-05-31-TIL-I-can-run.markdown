Today marks the end of week 5 of the Couch25k program. 5 weeks ago I was unable to make it through a minute and a half of light jogging without wheezing, spitting, panting, and nearly passing out. Today, I was able to complete a 20 minute run, start to finish, without any slow downs.

And it feels fantastic.

It's funny, because I used to always joke about how dumb running seemed to me. Why would someone want to just go out and run away from something that's not chasing them?

But 5 weeks in, I'm starting to get it. After todays run, getting in the groove and just pushing myself to keep moving, I totally get it.

After a long day of work and mental stress, there's something liberating about putting one foot in front of the other, focusing on your breething, and turning your brain off. Just you and your body, living in the moment.

I'm starting to be hopeful that running will have mental benefits to accompany the physical ones, and help me to start bringing my stress levels down.
