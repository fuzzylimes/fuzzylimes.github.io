Rathern than working on new stuff today, I took the time I would have spent learning new stuff to spend some time reflecting on my recent attempt at learning the Go language. It was much overdue, and the conclusion that I came to is slighly disheartening.

## The past 2 Months
For the past 2-3 months, I've been spending my free time trying to learn the Golang programing language. After reaching a point with my python programing, and feeling like I wanted to do something other than nodejs, I set my eyes on a compiled language. Rather than go with Java, which I'd taken in college and didn't really care for, I looked at other languages that were being used for web applications and I kept seeing `Go` come up.

After reading into it a bit, I was instantly interested in all of the flashing advertising words that kept poping up. It was super fast, both in run speed and in compile time (something I remember hating from Java), it had a super robust common library, and the language was growing in popularity every year.

So I bought a few classes, worked through different training online, bought a book or two. Spending time each week after work trying to get myself to learn the new language.

## The Initial Red Flag
As I've said a few times on this blog, I hated programing in school. It was taught so poorly, using languages that seemed to over complicate everything that they got in the way of understanding how things worked. I hated that feeling, and it made me hate coding.

It wasn't until after school that I found python and I instantly became hooked on writing little scripts and programs. It felt amazing, and I constaly wondered why on earth they wouldn't each something that was so much simpiler to start off with. Learn the basic concepts first, create some fun projects, and then move on to a lower level language. Advanced topics were taught right along side the basic data types, completly muddying the waters for me.

And unfortunately, that's how I felt going into Go. Despite what everything I read online saying that it was such an easy language to pick up and read, I found myself completely lost all of the time. I wasn't sure what I needed to use where, or how I'd be able to accomplish a task I'd do in either python or javascript.

As of today, after completing an entire course on Golang, as well as another half a course focused on web development, I couldn't tell you how to do the most basic items. Creating a simple list of items to be used, or trying to deal with JSON objects. No idea. And it's beyond frustrating. I've probably spent about 50 hours on the language and I can't even remember how to do basic items after using it on a nearly daily basis.

## And That Brings Me To...
I feel like I've reached that point where I'm done with Golang for now. I put in the time to try to learn it, but it's obviously not clicking for me. Even worse, it has completely killed my motivation to work on new projects. My goal was to start moving some of my apps over to Golang, but any time I've tried to start that process I can't get much further than setting up my basic routes.

Why stop now? Because honestly, it's not worth my time. Considering I'm coding as a hobby and that it's supposed to be a fun thing, I don't want to continue dragging myself on being miserable. I want to enjoy that feeling of writing new code for a program I want to make. I don't want that cloud looming over my head of "Not yet, you haven't done your lessons yet".

tl;tr: I've put in the ammount of time I'm willing to spend trying to get familiar with Go, and it's just not for me. I'm going to go back to languages that at least let me get things done.
