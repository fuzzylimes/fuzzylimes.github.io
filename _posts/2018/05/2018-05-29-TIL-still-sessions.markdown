After much frustration, I finally found the tutorial that I needed to help me get my head wrapped around sessions: [medium post](https://medium.com/@evangow/server-authentication-basics-express-sessions-passport-and-curl-359b7456003d)

I'm about halfway through the turtorial now, up to the point where it starts to cover the area that I'm most confused about with authenticating the requests based on the returned cookie. The first half did clear up how to use `express-session` with local file storage for the sessions to persist after restart.

Hopefully tomorrow I'll have more to write about once I've finished the tutorial.
