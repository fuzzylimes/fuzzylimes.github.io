I've been working with Javascript seriously now for about maybe a year or so. And in that time I've never actually had any time of code review. So as far as I'm concerned, while my code all seems to work and do what I want it to, it could all be considered to be "terrible" or "wrong".

Today I started reading up on best practices guidelines for JS to start getting a better idea of how I can start to be better about my writing. This isn't just styling tips, but also learning what types of short cuts can be used in different situations, and better understanding the base library.

Here's the guide that [I started working my way through today](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
