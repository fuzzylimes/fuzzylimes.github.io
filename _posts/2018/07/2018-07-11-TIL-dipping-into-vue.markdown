I got bored at work today so I started to take a look at Vue.JS, because why not.

Initial impressions after about an hour of reading up on it today: it seems much much much easier than angular or react. Having tried both and given up on both, Vue seemed miles easier to grasp from the start. My problem with Angular and React was that I never really understood what was going on, or why I was doing things. While Vue on the other hand seems so simple and clear as to why you're doing what you're doing.

After my initial time with it today, I think that I'm going to invest some time into trying to learn it on my own (i.e. stay far away from a Udemy course and see what I can do on my own).
