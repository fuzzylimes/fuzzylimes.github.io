Today's post will be lack luster and extremely light on content, because exucses.

I'll be honest with you: I never though I'd be doing this daily blog for as long as I have. I think it's been great seeing how much I've learned and grown over the last 3 or so months.

But the down side to it all is that some days, I'm honestly just forcing myself to sit down and try to come up with something to write. And most days when that happens, it's because I've waited until 8PM to start writing.

It appears that I'm mentally checked out by 8PM. I mean, I'm still here (obviously), but I just can't focus on anything other than winding down and getting ready for bed. With the rare exceptions of getting sucked into a project, I'm pretty much useless at this point in the night.

I need to keep this in mind going forward. I've actually find that the best blog entries have come from writing in the morning. Sitting down before work and working through a problem or reading up on something. Not trying to cram like a last minute school project.

This is more of a note to myself: do these things earlier in the day before you've forgotten everything you did during the day. It'll be much easier.
