After what has been the longest week of my working career, and continuing into a second week, I finally know my breaking point.

72 hours. That's how long this last week was. And it would have been longer if I hadn't passed out on Wednesday night and this afternoon. Today I fell asleep with the laptop on my lap in the middle of writing code. I was just done.

How am I feeling? I don't know what day it is, I can't remember basic things like whether or not I've fed the dog. I've skipped at least 4 meals in the last 3 days. I've lost about 5 lbs. I have no sense of priorities. My coding is sloppy. I'm incredibly irritable.

I wrote about this all a few months back, about how I needed to stop getting myself into these situations. This week was a prime example why.

So what did I learn today? I physically/mentally cannot do long work weeks.
