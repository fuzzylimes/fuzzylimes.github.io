Tonight I went through a basic tutorial for the Electron framework. Electron is a super neat javacript framework that makes it possible to develop multi-platform applications with just one set of code. It leverages nodejs and chromium to run html, css, and js code in the browser. Super neat and something that I've wanted to try out for a while now.

The tutorial I walked through did very simple stuff, simply just displaying some system information in a window. I didn't get into anything involving the render files, so I'm very much at the very start of things.

I think before I go any further with it, I'd like to spend a while going through react first. It's been on my list now for a few months now but I just haven't had time to play with it.
