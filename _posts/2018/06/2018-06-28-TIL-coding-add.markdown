This really isn't much of a big surprise to me, but lately I've just found myself struggling to focus on one thing and stick with it. I've been so busy with things at work, and I've created so many different tyepes of tools there, that I find it very hard to focus on learning something new when I get home.

I think I've written in the past about how I have a bad relationship with Udemy. I buy and buy and buy courses, but never seem to make it through any of them. And those that I do make it through, I coudn't really tell you what I learned from them. I'm very hands on, and watching lectures that just fly by or drag on after working 10 hours just don't seem to stick. Maybe I'm just watching bad lecturers.

Take React for instance. I was really looking forward to learning it. The firts few sections of this course were interesting and got me excited to work through it. And then we started to work on CSS again and I realized how much I want nothing to do with this. As much as I'd like to think front end design isn't too hard, I just really don't have the patience or creativity for it. And it doesn't really interest me.

...so then I start bobbing around. Maybe I should go back and focus more on ES6 javascript? Maybe I should go work more on NodeJS and learn more advanced topics? Maybe I should take a break from all of that and go learn some machine learning?

And thus the cycle begins again, where ultimately I end up dropping all of my learning activities and just watching TV because I can't decide on what I want to work on.
