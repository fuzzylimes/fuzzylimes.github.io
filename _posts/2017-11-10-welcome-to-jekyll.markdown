Boy this sure took longer than I expected to, also incredibly confusing for how simple it actually is.

In order to get this stood up, I followed along with the instructions detailed on this blog post [here][jekyll-blog].

In order to get things working, I had to get ruby updated first, which proved to be a task in and of itself. Having no background in ruby other than needing it for homebrew, I wasn't even away of how to upgrade it. Eviently `brew upgrade ruby` was enough to grab the latest version.

Now that this is up and running, I'd like to spend some time trying to understand the "magic" used to make it work. Quite confused as to why there isn't like a home html file somewhere to work with, so I'm assuming all of that is getting pulled in by the templating... thing.
